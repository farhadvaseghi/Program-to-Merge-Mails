# Python Program to Merge Mails
In this program, you'll learn to merge mails into one.

When we want to send the same invitations to many people, the body of the mail does not change. Only the name (and maybe address) needs to be changed.

Mail merge is a process of doing this. Instead of writing each mail separately, we have a template for body of the mail and a list of names that we merge together to form all the mails.
